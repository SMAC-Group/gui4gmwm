## Install Instructions

To install the `gui4gmwm` package, there is currently one option: [GitHub](https://github.com/SMAC-Group/gui4gmwm/).

### Installing the package through GitHub

For users who are interested in having the latest developments, this option is ideal. Though, more dependancies are required to run a stable version of the package. Most importantly, users **must** have a compiler installed on their machine that is compatible with R (e.g. Clang).

*The setup to obtain the development version of `gui4gmwm` is platform dependent.*

### Requirements and Dependencies

**OS X**

Some users report the need to use X11 to suppress shared library errors. To install X11, visit [xquartz.org](http://www.xquartz.org/).

**Linux**

Both curl and libxml are required.

For **Debian** systems, enter the following in terminal:

```{r, eval = F, engine='bash'}
sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev
```

For **RHEL** systems, enter the following in terminal:

```{r, eval = F, engine='bash'}
sudo yum install curl curl-devel libxml2 libxml2-dev
```

**All Systems**

The following R packages are also required. If you have made it this far, run the following code in an R session and you will be ready to use the devlopment version of `gui4gmwm`.

```{r, eval = F}
# Install dependencies
install.packages(c("RcppArmadillo","devtools","knitr","rmarkdown"))

# Install the package from GitHub without Vignettes/User Guides
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/gui4gmwm")

# Install the package with Vignettes/User Guides 
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/gui4gmwm", vignette = TRUE)
```
